# InsightForge ‚Äì CRISP-DM Project Log

> üìò This is a living document based on the CRISP-DM methodology. It will be updated continuously as the project progresses through each phase.

## 1. Business Understanding

### 1.1 Project Objectives
- Build an intelligent assistant to monitor and extract strategic information from 5 LATAM financial companies:
  - Nubank, Ual√°, Banco Santander M√©xico, Davivienda, BAC Credomatic.
- Detect key business signals: product launches, expansions, regulatory changes, and competitive moves.
- Deliver insights through an interactive dashboard using AI technologies (agents, embeddings, RAG, LLMs).

### 1.2 Business Success Criteria
- Weekly summaries or alerts with relevant updates.
- Automated detection of high-impact events.
- Scalable and modular backend with good documentation.

---

## 2. Data Understanding

### 2.1 Data Sources
- Websites of each company.
- News portals (scraping / RSS).
- APIs from Central Banks (Costa Rica, M√©xico, etc.).
- Optional: social media or job listings in future iterations.

### 2.2 Initial Observations
- [ ] Example: Nubank website has frequent blog/news updates.
- [ ] RSS feeds available for some banks, but others will require scraping.
- [ ] Central Bank APIs need authentication and parameter formatting.

---

## 3. Data Preparation

### 3.1 Planned Steps
- Collect news and company announcements.
- Normalize text (lowercase, remove stopwords, clean HTML).
- Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) for company names and dates.
- Preprocess for embeddings and similarity search.

### 3.2 Tools & Libraries
- `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `pandas`, `spaCy`, `langchain`, `datetime`, `re`

### 3.3 Notes
- [ ] Example: Davivienda uses dynamic content; may need Selenium or alternative strategy.

---

## 4. Modeling

### 4.1 AI/LLM Tasks
- Summarization of news articles.
- Classification of event relevance.
- Embedding generation + similarity for retrieval.

### 4.2 Agents Architecture
- Agent: Extracts key data from user query.
- Agent: Chooses correct country-specific data source.
- Agent: Queries APIs or scrapers.
- Agent: Validates inputs and fills missing parameters.
- Orchestrator: Manages routing between agents.

### 4.3 Initial Tests
- [ ] Run test queries through orchestrator
- [ ] Test vector search pipeline

---

## 5. Evaluation

### 5.1 Metrics
- Precision / recall for classification tasks.
- Accuracy of named entities extracted (companies, products, dates).
- Human feedback on quality of summaries and alerts.

### 5.2 Current Feedback
- [ ] To be added after first iteration

---

## 6. Deployment

### 6.1 Planned Stack
- Frontend: Streamlit or Gradio dashboard
- Backend: Python scripts with cron jobs or FastAPI
- Infrastructure: GitHub + local execution (phase 1), cloud automation (phase 2)

### 6.2 Automation Plans
- [ ] Daily or weekly data refresh
- [ ] Auto-generation of reports/alerts
- [ ] Slack or Telegram integration for alerts (optional)
